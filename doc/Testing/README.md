This folder contains the material related to the test design and user testing results.

The study design document was initially created with the intention of testing on real high school students but the actual testing process was on friends and peers. As such, some of the details in the document may not be relevant.

The question allocation spreadsheet details the question composition of the fixed length test and each module of the multistage test.

The post-test questionnaire, as the name implies, is given to participants after they have completed the multistage and fixed length tests. A copy of the questionnaire is included and the responses are recorded in a spreadsheet.

The users.json file contains the raw scores and responses from each user. Note that although the file contains data for 100 user IDs, only the IDs which appear in the post-test questionnaire are valid.
