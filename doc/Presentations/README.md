This folder contains the presentation components of the project.

Chronologically, the first component is the seminar presentation which summarises the literature review and establishes a timeline for the project.

Next is the tech demo and tech video which provides a mid-year progress update and outlines features of the implementation.

Last is the poster which summarises the overall project (i.e. application features and testing results) and concludes with suggestions for future work.
